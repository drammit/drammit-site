    <h1>12. General Terms</h1>
    <p><strong>A. Waiver and Severability</strong><br />The failure of Drammit to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

    <p><strong>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong><br />These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Netherlands without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your country of residence.
