    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <p>Our Services are aimed to let people share thoughts on their favourite whiskies. Any registered user of the Drammit Services can check-in drams, which is a post about a glass of whisky the person is drinking. A so-called Dram can contain a rating, a picture and a message about the Dram. Drams are publicly available by default.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how and when Drammit collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Drammit&nbsp;receives your information through our various websites, APIs, email notifications, applications (the &ldquo;Drammit Services&rdquo;), and our other covered services that link to this Policy (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use our Services on the web from an application such as Drammit on iOS or Drammit on Android. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Your information is controlled by Drammit, Fabriekstraat 6k, Deurne in The Netherlands. Despite this, you alone control and are responsible for the posting of your Dram and other content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of Service and Drammit Rules.</p>
    <p>Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to use your information in, and as a result to transfer it to and store it in, The Netherlands, and any other country where we operate. Privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where you live.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us here or at support@dramm.it.</p>
    <h1>Information Collection and Use</h1>
    <p>Basic Account Information: When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, or email address. On the Drammit Services, your name and username are listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Drammit Services, such as searching and viewing public user profiles, do not require registration.</p>
    <p>Contact Information<br />You may use your contact information, such as your email address, to customize your account or enable Services, for example for login verification. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications.</p>
    <h1>Additional Information</h1>
    <p>You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Drammit Services, such as a picture. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.</p>
    <h1>Drams, Following, and other Public Information:</h1>
    <p>Our Services are primarily designed to help you share your favourite whisky with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Drammit Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information includes the Drams you check-in; the metadata provided with Drams, such as when you checked-in; the language and time zone associated with your account; people you follow and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Drammit Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what whiskies you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Drammit Services public for as long as you do not delete it. The Drammit Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public Drams are immediately delivered our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Drammit content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content like photos via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
    <h1>Location Information:</h1>
    <p>Drammit may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your Dram and in your Drammit profile. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local whisky bars, Drams, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.</p>
    <h1>Cookies:</h1>
    <p>Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Drammit may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customise and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers&rsquo; settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
    <h1>Log Data:</h1>
    <p>When you use our Services, we may receive information (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;) such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications. Drammit uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customise the content we show you, including ads. If not already done earlier we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p>
    <h1>Commerce Services:</h1>
    <p>You may provide your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address (collectively, &ldquo;Payment Information&rdquo;), along with your shipping address, to complete a commerce transaction through our Services. To facilitate future purchases, we store your Payment Information (excluding CVV code) and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time using your account settings. We consider your Payment Information and shipping address private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by your purchases made through our Services (&ldquo;Transaction Data&rdquo;). Transaction Data may include the merchant&rsquo;s name and the date, time, and amount of the transaction.</p>
    <h1>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</h1>
    <p>Drammit uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Mixpanel Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your device as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in off of our Services.</p>
    <h1>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h1>
    <p>User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction. Other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they comments on your Dram.</p>
    <h1>Service Providers:</h1>
    <p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in The Nederlands and other countries. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your Payment Information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.</p>
    <h1>Commerce Transactions:</h1>
    <p>If you make a payment as part of a commerce transaction through our Services, we may provide the seller, commerce provider, marketplace, or charity with your name, email address, shipping address, Payment Information and Transaction Data to facilitate payment processing, order fulfilment, and dispute resolution (including payment and shipping disputes) and to help prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities. Please refer to these third parties&rsquo; privacy policies for information about their privacy practices.</p>
    <h1>Law and Harm:</h1>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Drammit&rsquo;s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defences or objections that you may have to a third party&rsquo;s, including a government&rsquo;s, request to disclose your information.</p>
    <h1>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</h1>
    <p>In the event that Drammit is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganisation or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates&rsquo; services, including the delivery of ads.</p>
    <h1>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</h1>
    <p>We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Drams, the people you follow or that follow you, or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).</p>
    <h1>Accessing and Modifying Your Personal Information:</h1>
    <p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your user profile information and public Drams, even after you have deleted the information from the Drammit Services or deactivated your account.</p>
    <h1>Our Policy Towards Children:</h1>
    <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13, or any legal drinking age for that matter. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at support@dramm.it. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child&rsquo;s account.</p>
    <h1>Changes to this Policy:</h1>
    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://www.dramm.it/privacy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
